Hi, Iâ€™m Yuki!

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Management Finance.
I love combining tech with visuals and datasets to optimize systems/solutions, and to solve real-world problems. Whether itâ€™s analyzing data to drive business decisions or building effective tools, I enjoy working at the intersection of analytics and engineering.
